# RemoveNode 2.0

This is a experimental new take on the Foundry Nuke `Remove Node`, the issue I have with nukes current Remove Node is that you are limited to 4 Channels at a given time, so I thought it would be fun to create one where you have unlimited access to the channels you want to remove in a single node with the similar functionality as the current Remove node.
